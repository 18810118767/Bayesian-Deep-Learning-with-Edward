    Parameters
    ----------
    latent_vars : dict of RandomVariable to RandomVariable
      Collection of random variables to perform inference on. Each
      random variable is binded to another random variable; the latter
      will infer the former conditional on data.
    data : dict, optional
      Data dictionary which binds observed variables (of type
      `RandomVariable`) to their realizations (of type `tf.Tensor`).
      It can also bind placeholders (of type `tf.Tensor`) used in the
      model to their realizations.
    model_wrapper : ed.Model, optional
      A wrapper for the probability model. If specified, the random
      variables in `latent_vars`' dictionary keys are strings used
      accordingly by the wrapper. `data` is also changed. For
      TensorFlow, Python, and Stan models, the key type is a string;
      for PyMC3, the key type is a Theano shared variable. For
      TensorFlow, Python, and PyMC3 models, the value type is a NumPy
      array or TensorFlow tensor; for Stan, the value type is the
      type according to the Stan program's data block.
