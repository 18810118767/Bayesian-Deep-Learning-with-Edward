% Where does the binding go?
% (1) model
% + no functionality is really present in order to do this. just like
% with the loss of information with plates vs vectorizatoin, we lose
% information about the random variable tying. all these must go into
% inference.
% (2) inference

% For how the tying works, see inference.

% TODO tie not needed, c.f., maja
% tie : dict of tf.Tensor to RandomVariable
%   TODO describe
%   as with the other dictionaries, it is not symmetrical. what does
%   tying really mean for two random variables/nodes? one must replace
%   the other. note this is different from parameter tying, which is
%   possibly simply by having things take in the same tf.variable as
%   argument.
