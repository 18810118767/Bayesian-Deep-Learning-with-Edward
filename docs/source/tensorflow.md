# Getting Started with TensorFlow

If you'd like to use this library for research, you have to learn TensorFlow. Trust me. It's worth the investment. As a heuristic, it takes roughly a day to have a good grasp of the essential mechanics behind the library.

Here's what I recommend for learning TensorFlow.

1. Read TensorFlow's [Getting Started](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.7/get_started/index.html). It tells you the essential objects that it works with.
2. Skim through the simple examples in these [TensorFlow tutorials](https://github.com/nlintz/TensorFlow-Tutorials). It gives you a big picture of the semantics and how the commands generally work with each other.
3. Skim through the example code in this library! If youâ€™re familiar with the underlying math for variational inference, going through the code base here will also teach you the mapping from math to TensorFlow.
