            "text": "Edward\n is a Python library for probabilistic modeling, inference,\nand criticism. It enables black box inference for models with discrete\nand continuous latent variables, neural network parameterizations, and\ninfinite dimensional parameter spaces. Edward serves as a fusion of\nthree fields: Bayesian statistics and machine learning, deep learning,\nand probabilistic programming.\n\n\nIt supports \nmodeling languages\n including\n\n\n\n\nTensorFlow\n (with neural network compositionality via \nKeras\n, \nPretty Tensor\n, or \nTensorFlow-Slim\n)\n\n\nStan\n\n\nPyMC3\n\n\noriginal Python using \nNumPy/SciPy\n\n\n\n\nIt supports \ninference\n via\n\n\n\n\nVariational inference\n\n\nDivergence minimization\n\n\nBlack box variational inference\n\n\nStochastic variational inference\n\n\nVariational auto-encoders\n\n\nInclusive KL divergence (KL(p || q))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarginal posterior optimization (empirical Bayes, marginal maximum likelihood)\n\n\nMaximum a posteriori (penalized maximum likelihood, maximum likelihood)\n\n\n\n\nIt supports \ncriticism\n of the model and inference via\n\n\n\n\nEvaluations on both supervised and unsupervised tasks\n\n\nPosterior predictive checks\n\n\n\n\nIt also has \nfeatures\n including\n\n\n\n\nTensorFlow\n for backend computation, which includes automatic differentiation, GPU support, computational graphs, optimization, and TensorBoard\n\n\nA library for probability distributions in TensorFlow\n\n\nDocumentation and tutorials\n\n\nExamples demonstrating state-of-the-art generative models and inference\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nYou can find a tutorial here\n\nfor getting started with Edward, as well as a\n\ntutorial here\n\nfor how to use it for research. We highlight a few examples, more of\nwhich can be found in \nexamples/\n:\n\n\n\n\nBayesian linear regression\n\n\nHierarchical logistic regression\n\n\nMixture model of Gaussians\n\n\nGaussian process classification\n\n\nBayesian neural network\n\n\nMixture density network\n\n\nVariational auto-encoder\n\n\n\n\nRead the documentation in the \nWiki\n.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nTo install the latest stable version, run\n\n\npip install edward\n\n\n\n\nTo install the latest development version, run\n\n\npip install -e \ngit+https://github.com/blei-lab/edward.git#egg=edward\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\n\n\nEdward is led by \nDustin Tran\n with guidance by \nDavid Blei\n.
